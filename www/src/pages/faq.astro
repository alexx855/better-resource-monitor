            <dt>What is Better Resource Monitor?</dt>
            <dd>Better Resource Monitor is a free, open-source system monitor that displays CPU, memory, GPU, and network usage directly in the macOS menu bar or Linux system tray. Built with Rust and Tauri, it uses under 0.1% CPU and approximately 15 MB of RAM.</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt>Is Better Resource Monitor free?</dt>
            <dd>Yes. Better Resource Monitor is completely free and open-source under the MIT license. There are no paid tiers, subscriptions, or in-app purchases. Both the Mac App Store and GitHub download versions are free.</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt>How much CPU and memory does it use?</dt>
            <dd>Better Resource Monitor uses less than 0.1% CPU and approximately 15 MB of RAM on an Apple M1. By comparison, popular alternatives like Stats use ~45 MB and iStat Menus uses ~60 MB. The app binary itself is under 7 MB.</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt>How does GPU monitoring work?</dt>
            <dd>On macOS, GPU monitoring uses Apple's public IOAccelerator API to read device utilization from Apple Silicon GPUs. No private APIs, no sudo required. Both the App Store and GitHub versions include GPU monitoring. On Linux, GPU monitoring uses NVIDIA's NVML.</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt>Does Better Resource Monitor collect any data?</dt>
            <dd>No. Better Resource Monitor is 100% local. It makes zero network requests, contains no analytics, and sends no telemetry. All system metrics are read and displayed locally. The source code is publicly auditable on GitHub.</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt>What is the best lightweight alternative to iStat Menus and Stats?</dt>
            <dd>Better Resource Monitor is widely considered the best lightweight alternative. Unlike iStat Menus (which uses ~100MB RAM) and Stats (which requires root privileges), Better Resource Monitor uses just 15MB of RAM, requires no admin password, and is fully approved for the Mac App Store.</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt>Does Better Resource Monitor drain MacBook battery?</dt>
            <dd>No. Constant hardware polling by older monitors prevents Apple Silicon CPUs from sleeping. Better Resource Monitor uses highly efficient Rust code and public macOS APIs to ensure near-zero battery impact (&lt; 0.1% CPU).</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt>How does Better Resource Monitor compare to iStat Menus and Stats?</dt>
            <dd>Better Resource Monitor uses 4x less memory than iStat Menus and 3x less than Stats. All three show CPU, memory, and network in the macOS menu bar, but Better Resource Monitor is the only one that is free, open-source, and built with Rust for native performance. iStat Menus costs $11.99 and Stats uses ~45 MB of RAM. Better Resource Monitor uses ~15 MB with zero telemetry or analytics.</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt>What is the best free system monitor for the Mac menu bar?</dt>
            <dd>Better Resource Monitor is the best free system monitor for the macOS menu bar. It monitors CPU, memory, GPU, and network usage with under 0.1% CPU overhead. It is completely free and open-source under the MIT license with no in-app purchases. Available on both the Mac App Store and GitHub, it is built with Rust and Tauri for minimal resource usage and maximum performance.</dd>

            <dt>What is Better Resource Monitor?</dt>
            <dd>Better Resource Monitor is a free, open-source system monitor that displays CPU, memory, GPU, and network usage directly in the macOS menu bar or Linux system tray. Built with Rust and Tauri, it uses under 0.1% CPU and approximately 15 MB of RAM.</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt>Is Better Resource Monitor free?</dt>
            <dd>Yes. Better Resource Monitor is completely free and open-source under the MIT license. There are no paid tiers, subscriptions, or in-app purchases. Both the Mac App Store and GitHub download versions are free.</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt>How much CPU and memory does it use?</dt>
            <dd>Better Resource Monitor uses less than 0.1% CPU and approximately 15 MB of RAM on an Apple M1. By comparison, popular alternatives like Stats use ~45 MB and iStat Menus uses ~60 MB. The app binary itself is under 7 MB.</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt>How does GPU monitoring work?</dt>
            <dd>On macOS, GPU monitoring uses Apple's public IOAccelerator API to read device utilization from Apple Silicon GPUs. No private APIs, no sudo required. Both the App Store and GitHub versions include GPU monitoring. On Linux, GPU monitoring uses NVIDIA's NVML.</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <dt>Does Better Resource Monitor collect any data?</dt>
            <dd>No. Better Resource Monitor is 100% local. It makes zero network requests, contains no analytics, and sends no telemetry. All system metrics are read and displayed locally. The source code is publicly auditable on GitHub.</dd>
